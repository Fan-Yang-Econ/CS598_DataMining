Presentation

Cutting-edge new technologies are generally reported initially in research papers. Thus reading frontier research papers is essential for detecting and tracking emerging new techniques in any domain. The online seminar component of this Capstone is designed to provide you an opportunity to read, present and discuss selected frontier papers in the general area of data mining. The format will be similar to an online conference with multiple parallel sessions of presentations. Each student will read one paper and produce a presentation of the paper, which will be made available to all other students in the class to help them learn about the paper. By collaborating in this way, the students can help each other quickly digest several frontier papers without spending too much time.

 In general, the papers to read will be recently published papers selected from major publication venues in the general area of data mining by the instructor and TA working together with the students. Student preferences will be accommodated by having students sign up for papers that are interesting to them.

 You will each be assigned to read one paper in depth and produce a presentation of the paper.  Reading a paper in depth enables you to fully digest a frontier topic and learn about a new technique or new finding presented in the paper. Critically examining the novel contributions made in a paper and how the authors presented the novel contributions are also beneficial if you would like to write and publish your own papers.

You are required to watch at least 6 presentations and discuss all of them.  Please give preference to presentations with fewer than 6 discussions to have balanced discussion activities.

The presenter of each paper should make an effort to respond to as many questions and comments posted by others as possible. If there are no more than 6 questions or comments posted, you are required to post a response comment to every one of them; if there are more than 6 questions or comments, you are required to post at least 6 responses.

Students will be asked to peer grade 3 of their peers' presentations. Since you have already watched and participated in the discussion of multiple presentations, the workload of peer grading will be light, while your feedback to the presenter can be potentially very beneficial.

Your presentation and question answering (i.e., responses to questions and comments from the participants about your presentation) will be peer-graded, which allows your peers to learn about a paper efficiently via watching your presentation video while also allowing you to receive feedback from your peers on your presentation.




Presentation Task

Before you produce your presentation, you must obtain a reasonably clear understanding of the content of the assigned paper. If you encounter any difficulty in understanding a paper, please post a question on Campuswire. You may sometimes need to read a cited reference to understand some needed background knowledge for digesting a paper, but please do not overwhelm yourself by reading too many cited references unless you have the time and are truly interested in all the details since your primary goal is to understand the contributions of the paper that you are assigned, not other papers cited in the paper. As long as you have a grasp of the contributions (i.e., new knowledge) reported in the assigned paper, you do not necessarily have to know well about all the previous work on which the authors have built their contributions. In general, we expect you to spend up to 10 hours reading a paper. If you find yourself spending more than 10 hours, please let the TA and the instructor know so that we may provide help.

Once you have a good understanding of the paper, you are required to produce a presentation. Please read the grading rubric before you produce your presentation so that you know clearly what the graders will be looking for in your presentation. As long as you satisfy the requirements specified in the rubric description, you can design your presentation in any way that you like. Your presentation should be a voiced slide presentation (e.g., a voiced PowerPoint presentation). The length should be anywhere between 15 minutes and 20 minutes. The purpose of your presentation is to summarize what you have learned in the paper, point out and explain the new contribution made in the paper (i.e., new knowledge added by this paper on top of all the previous work), and present your own thoughts on the paper. Accordingly, your presentation will also be graded in these three dimensions: 1) Utility as a summary of the paper: Is it an informative summary of the paper that can help the audience to learn about the main content of the paper? 2) Clarity in describing the contribution of the paper: Does the presentation include a clear description of the main contribution of the paper? 3) Inclusion of opinions: Does the presentation include the presenter’s own opinions on the paper such as criticisms of the paper, ideas for improving the paper, or ideas about new applications enabled or inspired by the research results in the paper?

What to submit:

1) Upload your presentation to Illinois Media Space.

2) Submit the link to your presentation on Coursera.



Review criteria

Your presentation will be graded by three peers. They will also read the paper that you present and watch your presentation to grade it.

Grading will be based on 5 dimensions with the following weighting:

Uploaded a video with appropriate length: 40%

Usefulness of the presentation as a summary of the paper: 20%

Clarity of describing major contributions of the paper: 10%

Presenter’s own opinions or analysis of the paper:  10%

Question answering in online discussion: 20%
